Simple Grey
===========

A responsive WordPress theme with a simple grey color palette.

## Theme Features

### Customization
This theme has support for all of the built-in WordPress [Theme Features](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Features) except for Custom Backgrounds. You can use the Theme Customizer for easy modification of the following theme settings:

#### Site Branding
In addition to the Site Title and Description, you can:
- add a drop shadow to elements in the Header
- upload a logo to be displayed in the Header
- Apply styles to the logo: slightly rounded corners, or a circle effect.
- Upload a Site Icon to be used as a browser favicon and app icon on mobile operating systems.

#### Header Image
This section allows you to upload an image to be used as the background for the Header

#### Menus
This theme includes one Primary Navigation menu area, which is displayed right under the page Header.

#### Navigation
You can set the Primary Navigation menu to any of the following styles:
- **Flat** - this will present all the links inline regardless of the hierarchy of the menu.
- **Hierarchical** - this style presents the menus as nested lists
- **Drop Down** - this style displays the menu in a fully accessible nested drop-down style.

#### Widget Areas
This theme defines the following widget areas:
- **Secondary** - this is the main widget area, appears as a sidebar.
- **Featured** - This is an additional widget area used by the Feature Page template, used for featured content widgets, usually presented full width.
- **Footer** - a responsive widget area in the footer that responsively switches between 1, 2 and 3 columns depending upon available space.

#### Footer
The footer has two text fields (Top and Bottom), for displaying credits, copyright info and the like in the footer.
- **Footer Top Text** is displayed at the top of the footer, above the Footer Widgets.
- **Footer Bottom Text** is displayed under the Footer Widgets.
- You can also choose whether or not to Display the WordPress and Theme credits at the bottom of the footer.

### Web fonts
This theme uses the [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?selection.family=Open+Sans) web font via Google Fonts. In addition, it includes the following icon fonts:
- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/)
- [More Vectors](https://github.com/peterhebert/More-Vectors-Icon-Font)

### Feature Page Template
This theme includes a *Feature Page* template, which can be used for a front page, or a landing page. It contains an additional widget area that allows you to have full-width widgets.

## Complementary Plugins
The following plugins are quite useful in conjunction with this theme:
- [Widget CSS Classes](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/widget-css-classes/) - allows you to apply CSS classes to any widget. For example:
    - by applying the class 'icons' to widgets in the footer, the theme will allow you to style social media icons to match the footer (dark grey instead of the blue link color). See this in action at [my personal site](https://peterhebert.com/)
    - by applying the class 'columns' to widgets in the Featured widget area, you can have your widgets be in columns, instead of full width.
- [Display Widgets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/display-widgets/) - allows you to choose which posts or pages your widgets are displayed on.
- [Custom Query Shortcode](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-query-shortcode/) - provides a shortcode for using custom queries in your page or post. Simple Grey includes support for using shortcodes within Widgets, so you could use this to generate complex layouts or featured content areas, slideshows, etc.


## Credits
